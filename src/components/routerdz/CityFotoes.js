So, when in 2001 the first year began the installation of the first 40 cm of prim - in honor of the Orange Alternative - the structure was liked not only by guests and residents of the city, but also by representatives of the authorities. For the next twenty years in Wroclaw, figures of dwarves that fit so organically into urban architecture continue to be installed.</p>
